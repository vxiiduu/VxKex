# VxKex

Hello, sadly everything has an end... I was been working on VxKex, a tool that allows running programs designed for Windows 10+ on Windows 7, it was amazing adventure for me.

Life has thrown some unexpected challenges my way. My mom had to retire early due to serious health issues, and I became her primary caregiver and because of that i had to temporarily stop the development of VxKex. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has used the software and supported me along the way.

The source code and binaries are still available, so you can continue using and improving the project as you see fit.
